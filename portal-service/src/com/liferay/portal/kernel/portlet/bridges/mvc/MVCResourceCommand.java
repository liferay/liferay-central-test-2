/**
 * Provides an interface to allow the portlet to serve a resource. This
 * interface can only be used when the portlet is based on
 * {@link MVCPortlet}.
 *
 * <p>
 * The resource command that will be invoked is determined based on two
 * different factors:
 * </p>
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * The portlet name that the resource url is referring to.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * The <code>ResourceID</code> of the resource request.
 * </li>
 *
 * <p>
 * Implementations of this interface must be OSGi components that are registered
 * in the OSGi Registry with the following properties:
 * </p>
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <code>javax.portlet.name</code>: The portlet name associated to this resource
 * command.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <code>mvc.command.name</code>: the command name that will match the
 * ResourceID of the resource request. This name cannot contain any
 * comma (<code>,</code>).
 * </li>
 *
 * <p>
 * The method <code>serveResource</code> in {@link MVCPortlet}
 * will search in the OSGi Registry the resource command that will match both
 * the portlet name and the ResourceID of the resource request with the
 * properties <code>javax.portlet.name</code> and <code>mvc.command.name</code>.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * In general, only one resource command will be executed per portlet resource
 * url. However, if the ResourceID of the resource request is a comma separated
 * list of multiple names, {@link MVCPortlet} will find the resource commands
 * that matches and they will all be invoked sequentially based
 * on the order they were specified in the resourceID of the resource request.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Every time there is more than one resource command registered for the same
 * portlet name and with the same command name, only the one with the they
 * highest service ranking will be used.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * {@link BaseMVCResourceCommand} is an abstract class that implements this
 * interface and can be used by extending it by third party developers to
 * simplify the use of resource commands.
 * </p>
