/**
 * Provides an interface that defines what information should be returned by the
 * item selector view when any entity is selected.
 *
 * This information is also used by the item selector to decide which item
 * selector views will be displayed to the user. Only the item selector views
 * that can return the item selector return type will be displayed.
 *
 * The item selector return types are used in two different cases:
 *
 * 1. The item selector view specifies a list of the supported item selector
 * return types for that view using the method
 * {@link ItemSelectorView#getSupportedItemSelectorReturnTypes()}
 *
 * 2. When creating a new item selector criterion we need to specify a list of
 * the desired item selector return types that the client is expecting to
 * receive when an entity is selected.
