<p>2016 is almost at a close, and our global communities are as busy as ever. Around the world, diverse groups are working together to create meaningful connections and light up the commons. From announcements of new communities in <a href="https://creativecommons.org/2016/03/17/creative-commons-turkey-joins-cc-affiliate-network/" target="_blank" data-href="https://creativecommons.org/2016/03/17/creative-commons-turkey-joins-cc-affiliate-network/">Turkey</a> and <a href="https://creativecommons.org/2016/11/22/introducing-cc-panama/" target="_blank" data-href="https://creativecommons.org/2016/11/22/introducing-cc-panama/">Panama</a> to the best in music, photography, and open education from communities around the world, we’re pleased to present this year’s best from the commons as chosen by our affiliates and staff.</p>

<h4><strong>FILIP STOJANOVSKI, CC MACEDONIA</strong></h4>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/fosim/albums" target="_blank" data-href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/fosim/albums">Vančo Džambaski</a> is a photoactivist who publishes tons of HQ HR photos via flickr using CC BY-NC-SA.&nbsp;He attends events, mostly organized by civil society, as well as protests and demonstrations, and publishes albums of selected photos from each event. His photos are then used by media both local and foreign (incl. Global Voices), as well as social media users, and on the long run, he provided photos from historical events for some books even. We are working on spreading the CC idea amongst activists and independent media as a way for them to increase visibility.</p>
