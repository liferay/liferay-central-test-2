<p>
	This package provides partial implementations for the interfaces in
	{@link com.liferay.frontend.js.loader.modules.extender.npm.model} that are
	provided by default by Liferay Portal.
</p>
<p>
	These implementations differ from the basic implementations in that they
	provide implementations to allow
	{@link com.liferay.frontend.js.loader.modules.extender.npm.JSBundleAsset}
	to be retrieved using URLs served by the Portal.
