	Defines the interfaces and utilities for the NPM registry facility.
	Interfaces and classes here define a model for describing NPM packages and
	modules so they can be tracked by the {@link
	com.liferay.frontend.js.loader.modules.extender.internal.npm.NPMRegistry}.
</p>
<p>
	In addition, the {@link
	com.liferay.frontend.js.loader.modules.extender.npm.JSBundleProcessor}
	interface provides a way to extend the portal by deploying OSGi components
	that analyze bundles in search for NPM packages and modules.
</p>
<p>
	A brief overview of the NPM model is provided defining the following
	concepts:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<b>bundle:</b> an OSGi bundle containing one or more NPM packages.
		Bundles have a symbolic name and an ID assigned by OSGi (usually a
		number).
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>package</b>: an NPM package containing several JS modules and
		described by a <code>package.json</code> file. Packages may depend on
		other packages. Packages have a name and version that uniquely
		identifies them.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>module</b>: a self contained executable unit that may depend on other
		modules. Modules always live inside packages. Modules have a name, but
		they depend on their owner package to be accessed.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>dependency</b>: a directed relation between two modules or between
		two packages. Note that all module dependencies are resolved in the
		context of the package that contains the depending module. For example,
		if package <i>P1</i> at version 1.0.0 depends on package <i>P2</i> at
		version 2.1.0, and the module <i>M1</i> in package <i>P1</i> depends on
		module <i>M2</i> on package <i>P2</i>, the reference to <i>M2</i> from
		<i>M1</i> will be resolved traversing the dependency from <i>P1</i>
		version 1.0.0 to <i>P2</i> version 2.1.0.
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	In addition to the previous concepts defined by NPM, the portal also has
	important concepts:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<b>package ID</b>: the string that univocally identifies an NPM package
		deployed inside the portal. It is composed by the ID of the bundle
		containing the package and the package name and version (e.g.,
		<code>625/isarray@1.0.0</code>).
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>module ID:</b> the string that univocally identifies an NPM module
		deployed inside the portal. It is composed by the ID of the package
		containing the module and the module name (e.g.,
		<code>625/isarray@1.0.0/lib/index</code>).
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>resolved module</b>: the unique reference module used by copies of
		the same NPM module. Since more than one copy of a specific NPM module
		can be deployed to the portal in different OSGi bundles, the NPM module
		copies must be resolved to one unique reference module (selected among
		ones available).
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>resolved module ID</b>: the ID of the reference module used by copies
		of the same module. Once the copies of the same module are resolved to a
		unique reference module, its ID can be simplified and no longer needs to
		contain the bundle ID. This is because there's no longer a need to
		distinguish between different bundles. Thus, the resolved module ID is
		defined based on the package name and version (e.g.,
		<code>isarray@1.0.0/lib/index</code>.
	</li>
</ul>
