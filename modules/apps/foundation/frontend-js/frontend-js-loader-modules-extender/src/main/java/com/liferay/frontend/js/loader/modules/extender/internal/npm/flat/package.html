<html>
<body>
<p>
	Provides complete implementations for the interfaces in {@link
	com.liferay.frontend.js.loader.modules.extender.npm.model} that are provided
	by default by Liferay Portal.
</p>
<p>
	These implementations assume a particular OSGi bundle structure to locate
	the contents of modules. These are <code>flat</code> structures and look
	like the following example:
</p>
<pre>
	- my-bundle.jar
		- META-INF
			- resources
				- package.json
				- node_modules
				- isarray@1.0.0
					- package.json
				...
				- isarray@2.1.0
					- package.json
				...
				- isobject@1.0.0
					- package.json
				...
			...
</pre>
<p>
	All NPM packages live in <code>META-INF/resources/node_modules</code>
	and are laid out in a flat (not nested) disposition where each package
	resides next to the others.
</p>
