<p>
	This package provides complete implementations for the interfaces in
	{@link com.liferay.frontend.js.loader.modules.extender.npm.model} that are
	provided by default by Liferay Portal.
</p>
<p>
	These implementations assume a particular OSGi bundle structure to be able
	to locate the contents of modules. We call such structure `flat` and it
	looks like the following example:
</p>
<pre>
	📄 my-bundle.jar
	   📂 META-INF
	      📂 resources
	         📄 package.json
	         📂 node_modules
	            📂 isarray@1.0.0
	               📄 package.json
                   …
	            📂 isarray@2.1.0
	               📄 package.json
                   …
	            📂 isobject@1.0.0
	               📄 package.json
                   …
	         …
</pre>
<p>
	As it can be seen, all NPM packages live in META-INF/resources/node_modules
	and are laid out in a flat (not nested) disposition, where each package
	lives next to the others.
</p>
