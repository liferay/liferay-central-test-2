additional-configurations-help=Set custom settings for embedded Elasticsearch, in YML format (elasticsearch.yml).
additional-index-configurations-help=Set custom settings for the Liferay index, in JSON or YML format (Elasticsearch Create Index API).
additional-type-mappings-help=Set custom mappings for the LiferayDocumentType, in JSON format (Elasticsearch Put Mapping API). This value should be set with new field mappings only. If you set this value with any overlapping mappings for default fields, index creation fails. To replace default mappings entirely, use overrideTypeMappings.
elastic.search.configuration.name=Elasticsearch
http-cors-configurations-help=Set custom settings for HTTP CORS, in YML format (elasticsearch.yml).
index-name-prefix-help=Set the prefix for the search index name. This value should not be changed under normal conditions. If you change this value, you must also perform a reindex all operation for the portal and then manually delete the old index using the Elasticsearch administration console.
log-exceptions-only-help=Set to true to only log exceptions from Elasticsearch and not rethrow them.
override-type-mappings-help=Override mappings for the entire LiferayDocumentType, in JSON format (Elasticsearch Put Mapping API). If you set this value, index creation ignores the default mappings definition and any extension points, using this alternative mappings definition instead. Use this if you need LiferayDocumentType to be created with nonstandard mappings for default fields. If you just need to add new custom mappings without overlapping any defaults, use additionalTypeMappings.
sync-search=If this is checked, search runs on invoker thread rather than in Elasticsearch's search threadpool. This only applies to EMBEDDED operation mode.
