additional-configurations-help=Set custom settings for embedded Elasticsearch, in YML format (elasticsearch.yml).
additional-index-configurations-help=Set custom settings for the Liferay index, in JSON or YML format (Elasticsearch Create Index API).
additional-type-mappings-help=Set custom mappings for the LiferayDocumentType, in JSON format (Elasticsearch Put Mapping API).
bootstrap-mlockall-help=Set to true to try to lock the process address space into RAM, preventing any Elasticsearch memory from being swapped out.
client-transport-ignore-cluster-name-help=Set to true to ignore cluster name validation of connected nodes.
client-transport-nodes-sampler-interval-help=Set this value to instruct the client node on how often to sample / ping the nodes listed and connected.
client-transport-sniff-help=Set to true to enable cluster sniffing and dynamically discover available data nodes in the cluster.
cluster-name-help=Set the name of the cluster to join. The name should match the remote cluster when Operation Mode is set to remote.
discovery-zen-ping-unicast-hosts-port-help=Set the range of ports to use when building the value for discovery.zen.ping.unicast.hosts. Multiple Elasticsearch nodes on a range of ports can act as gossip routers at the same computer.
elastic.search.configuration.name=Elasticsearch
http-cors-allow-origin-help=Set the origins to allow when HTTP CORS is enabled.
http-cors-configurations-help=Set custom settings for HTTP CORS, in YML format (elasticsearch.yml).
http-cors-enabled-help=Set to false to disable cross-origin resource sharing, i.e. whether a browser on another origin can do requests to Elasticsearch. If disabled, web front end tools like elasticsearch-head may be unable to connect.
http-enabled-help=Set to false to disable the http layer entirely on nodes which are not meant to serve REST requests directly.
index-name-prefix-help=Set the prefix for the search index name. This value should not be changed under normal conditions. If you change this value, you must also perform a reindex all operation for the portal and then manually delete the old index using the Elasticsearch administration console.
log-exceptions-only-help=Set to true to only log exceptions from Elasticsearch and not rethrow them.
network-bind-host-help=Set the network interface(s) a node should bind to in order to listen for incoming requests.
network-host-help=Set this value to instruct the node to bind to this hostname or IP address and publish (advertise) this host to other nodes in the cluster. This is a shortcut which sets the bind host and the publish host at the same time.
network-publish-host-help=Set the single interface that the node advertises to other nodes in the cluster, so that those nodes can connect to it.
operation-mode-help=Set to Remote to connect to a remote standalone Elasticsearch cluster. Set to Embedded to start Portal with an internal Elasticsearch instance in the same JVM. Embedded operation mode is unsupported.
retry-on-conflict-help=Set the number of retries if a version conflict occurs because the document was updated between getting it and updating it.
transport-tcp-port-help=Set the port to bind for communication between nodes. Accepts a single value or a range.
transport-addresses-help=Set the addresses of the remote nodes to connect to. This value is required when Operation Mode is set to remote.
