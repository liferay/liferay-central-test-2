additional-configurations-help=Custom settings for embedded Elasticsearch, in YML format (elasticsearch.yml).
additional-index-configurations-help=Custom settings for the Liferay index, in JSON or YML format (Elasticsearch Create Index API).
additional-type-mappings-help=Custom mappings for the LiferayDocumentType, in JSON format (Elasticsearch Put Mapping API).
bootstrap-mlockall-help=If this is checked, the process address space is locked into RAM, preventing any Elasticsearch memory from being swapped out.
client-transport-ignore-cluster-name-help=If this is checked, the cluster name validation of connected nodes is ignored.
client-transport-nodes-sampler-interval-help=Instructs the client node on how often to sample/ping the nodes listed and connected.
client-transport-sniff-help=If this is checked, cluster sniffing is enabled to dynamically discover available nodes in the cluster.
cluster-name-help=The name of the cluster to join. The name should match the remote cluster when Operation Mode is set to remote.
discovery-zen-ping-unicast-hosts-port-help=Range of ports to use when building the discovery.zen.ping.unicast.hosts value. Multiple Elasticsearch nodes on a range of ports can act as gossip routers at the same computer.
elastic.search.configuration.name=Elasticsearch
http-cors-allow-origin-help=Origins to allow when HTTP CORS is enabled.
http-cors-configurations-help=Custom settings for HTTP CORS, in YML format (elasticsearch.yml).
http-cors-enabled-help=If this is checked, cross-origin resource sharing is enabled, which determines whether a browser on another origin can make requests to Elasticsearch. If disabled, web front-end tools like elasticsearch-head may be unable to connect.
http-enabled-help=If this is checked, the HTTP layer is enabled. If unchecked, the HTTP layer entirely on nodes which are not meant to serve REST requests directly are disabled.
index-name-prefix-help=The prefix for the search index name. This value should not be changed under normal conditions. If you change this value, you must also reindex the portal and then manually delete the old index using the Elasticsearch administration console.
log-exceptions-only-help=If this is checked, logs exceptions only from Elasticsearch and does not rethrow them.
network-bind-host-help=The network interface(s) a node should bind to in order to listen for incoming requests.
network-host-help=The hostname or IP address binded to the node, which is used to publish (advertise) the host to other nodes in the cluster. This is a shortcut which sets the bind host and the publish host at the same time.
network-publish-host-help=The single interface the node advertises to other nodes in the cluster, so that those nodes can connect to it.
operation-mode-help=The REMOTE operation mode connects to a remote standalone Elasticsearch cluster. The EMBEDDED operation mode starts Portal with an internal Elasticsearch instance in the same JVM. The EMBEDDED operation mode is unsupported.
retry-on-conflict-help=The number of retries if a version conflict occurs because the document was updated between retrieving it and updating it.
transport-addresses-help=The remote node addresses to connect to. This value is required when Operation Mode is set to REMOTE.
transport-tcp-port-help=The port to bind for communication between nodes. Accepts a single value or a range (e.g., 9300-9400).
