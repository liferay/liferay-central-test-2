s3-region=S3 Region
s3-region-help=Amazon S3 Regions let the user choose the geographical region where Amazon S3 stores the user-created buckets. Choose an Amazon S3 Region to optimize latency, minimize costs, or address regulatory requirements. Objects stored in an Amazon S3 Region never leave that region unless explicitly transferred to another region.
s3-storage-class=S3 Storage Class
s3-storage-class-help=Amazon S3 offers multiple storage classes for different customers' needs. The STANDARD storage class is used by default, and means that redundant copies of data will be stored in different locations. The REDUCED_REDUNDANCY storage class offers customers who are using Amazon S3 to store non-critical, reproducible data a low-cost, highly available storage option; however, this option is less redundant.
s3.store.configuration.name=S3 Store Configuration
secret-key=Secret Key
