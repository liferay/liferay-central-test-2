access-key=Access Key
access-key-help=Set the AWS account access key.
bucket-name=Bucket Name
bucket-name-help=Set the bucket name used by S3 to store files.
cache-dir-clean-up-expunge=Cache Directory Clean Up Expunge
cache-dir-clean-up-expunge-help=Set the number of days a file is kept in the cache.
cache-dir-clean-up-frequency=Cache Directory Clean Up Frequency
cache-dir-clean-up-frequency-help=Set the ratio between the number of calls to the file cache clean method and the actual file cache clean. Set this property to 1 to always clean. Higher numbers lower the frequency.
connection-timeout=Connection Timeout
connection-timeout-help=Set the amount of time to wait (in milliseconds) when initially establishing a connection before timing out. A value of 0 means infinity, and is not recommended.
core-pool-size=Core Pool Size
core-pool-size-help=Set the initial number of threads used to upload parts.
http-client-max-connections=Maximum HTTP Connections
http-client-max-connections-help=Set the maximum number of allowed open HTTP connections.
http-client-max-error-retry=Maximum HTTP Retries
http-client-max-error-retry-help=Set the maximum number of retry attempts for failed retriable requests.
max-pool-size=Maximum Pool Size
max-pool-size-help=Set the maximum number of threads to use when uploading parts.
minimum-uploads-part-size=Minimum Part Size
minimum-uploads-part-size-help=Set the minimum part size for upload parts. Decreasing the minimum part size causes multipart uploads to be split into a larger number of smaller parts. Setting this value too low has a negative effect on transfer speeds, causing extra latency and network communication for each part.
multipart-upload-threshold=Multipart Upload Threshold
multipart-upload-threshold-help=Set the size threshold (in bytes) when using multipart uploads. Uploads over this size automatically use a multipart upload strategy, while uploads smaller than this threshold use a single connection to upload the whole object.
ntlm-proxy-domain=NTLM Proxy Domain
ntlm-proxy-domain-help=Set the Windows domain name for an NTLM proxy. If you're not using a Windows NTLM proxy, do not set this property.
ntlm-proxy-workstation=NTLM Proxy Workstation
ntlm-proxy-workstation-help=Set the Windows workstation name for an NTLM proxy. If you're not using a Windows NTLM proxy, do not set this property.
proxy-auth-type=Proxy Authentication Type
proxy-auth-type-help=Set the proxy authentication type to use when connecting to an S3 Service. "None" configures no proxy. "Username-password" configures a proxy; for this configuration, specify values for proxy user name and proxy password. "Ntlm" configures a Windows NTLM proxy; for this configuration, specify values for proxy user name, proxy password, NTLM proxy domain, and NTLM proxy workstation.
proxy-host-help=Set the proxy host the client uses to connect.
proxy-password=Proxy Password
proxy-password-help=Set the proxy password to use if connecting through a proxy.
proxy-port-help=Set the proxy port the client uses to connect.
proxy-username=Proxy User Name
proxy-username-help=Set the proxy user name to use if connecting through a proxy.
s3-region=S3 Region
s3-region-help=Set the Amazon S3 Region, which represents a geographical region where Amazon S3 stores the user-created buckets. Amazon S3 Regions are used to optimize latency, minimize costs, and address regulatory requirements. Objects stored in an Amazon S3 Region never leave that region unless explicitly transferred to another region.
s3-storage-class=S3 Storage Class
s3-storage-class-help=Set the Amazon S3 storage class. The STANDARD storage class is used by default, and means that redundant copies of data will be stored in different locations. The REDUCED_REDUNDANCY storage class is intended to store non-critical, reproducible data, offering a low-cost, highly available storage option; however, this option is less redundant.
s3.store.configuration.name=S3 Store Configuration
secret-key=Secret Key
secret-key-help=Set the AWS account secret key.
