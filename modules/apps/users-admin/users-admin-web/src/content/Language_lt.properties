javax.portlet.description.com_liferay_users_admin_web_portlet_UsersAdminPortlet=Users are individuals who perform tasks using the portal.

User groups can cross organizational boundaries, and can be used to assign all members to other collections, such as sites or roles. User groups may also be used to customize personal site templates for members. (Automatic Copy)
