javax.portlet.description.125=Users are individuals who perform tasks using the portal. Administrators can create new users or deactivate existing users. Users can join sites, be placed into organization hierarchies, be delegated permissions in roles, or be collected into user groups. User groups can cross organizational boundaries, and can be used to assign all members to other collections, such as sites or roles. User groups may also be used to customize personal site templates for members.
