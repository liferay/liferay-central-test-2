default-teams-assignment-help=Select the teams that the newly assigned site members are a member of.
page-versioning-help=Page versioning allows you to work in parallel in different variations of the pages. It also allows you to keep track of the history of changes in those pages.
staged-portlets-alert=When a portlet is checked, its data is copied to staging and it may not be possible to edit them directly in live. When unchecking a portlet make sure that any changes done in staging are published first, because otherwise they might be lost.
staged-portlets-help=Portlets that are checkmarked are <em>Staged</em>. This means that their data is published automatically whenever a page containing them is published. Those portlets which are disabled and checkmarked are always automatically exported even if they are not on the page. Those which are disabled and not checkmarked are never automatically published. <em>Collaboration</em> portlets, such as <em>Blogs</em>, <em>Message Boards</em> and <em>Wiki</em> are excluded from being <em>Staged</em> by default as their data typically originates in Live. Effectively, when a portlet is <em>NOT Staged</em> the <em>Live</em> environment contains the only important data. When <em>Local Live</em> staging is used, the same data is displayed whether viewing the portlet from either environment.
trash-entries-max-age-help=Number of days that entries are kept in the Recycle Bin. Entries that have been in the Recycle Bin for more than this time are automatically deleted.
