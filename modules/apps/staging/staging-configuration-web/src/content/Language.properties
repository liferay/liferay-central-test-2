live-group-remote-staging-alert=The current site currently acts as a live site for a remote staging environment. It can be still enabled as a staging environment to achieve multiple step staging although some of the staging options have been disabled.
local-live=Local Live
page-versioning=Page Versioning
page-versioning-help=Page versioning lets you work in parallel in different variations of the pages. It also lets you keep track of the history of changes in those pages.
remote-publish-help=In order to be able to publish changes to a <em>Remote Host/IP</em>, the publishing server must be added to the list of allowed servers. This is done by adding the IP of the publishing server to the property <code>tunnel.servlet.hosts.allowed</code> in the <code>portal-ext.properties</code> file of the target server. <em>Remote Path Context</em> is only required if a non-root portal servlet context path is used on the target server. Access to this context must not be blocked by either proxies or firewalls. Also note that if the target server is a cluster, it is safe to set the <em>Remote Host/IP</em> to the load balanced address of the cluster in order to increase the high availability of the publishing process.
staged-content=Staged Content
staged-portlets-alert=When a portlet is checked, its data is copied to staging and it may not be possible to edit them directly in live. When unchecking a portlet, make sure that any changes done in staging are published first, because otherwise they might be lost.
staged-portlets-help=Portlets that are checkmarked are <em>Staged</em>. This means that their data is published automatically whenever a page containing them is published. Those portlets which are disabled and checkmarked are always automatically exported, even if they are not on the page. Those which are disabled and not checkmarked are never automatically published. <em>Collaboration</em> portlets, such as <em>Blogs</em>, <em>Message Boards</em>, and <em>Wiki</em> are excluded from being <em>Staged</em> by default as their data typically originates in Live. Effectively, when a portlet is <em>NOT Staged</em> the <em>Live</em> environment contains the only important data. When <em>Local Live</em> staging is used, the same data is displayed whether viewing the portlet from either environment.
staging-cannot-be-used-for-this-site-because-the-propagation-of-changes-from-the-site-template-is-enabled=Staging cannot be used for this site because the propagation of changes from the site template is enabled.
staging-type=Staging Type
staging-type-local=A clone of the current site is created which contains copies of all existing pages and data of portlets configured to be staged (see <em>Staged Portlets</em> below). This clone becomes the <em>Staging</em> environment while the original becomes the <em>Live</em> environment.
staging-type-remote=A connection is made between this site and one existing in a remote server. This site becomes the <em>Staging</em> environment while the remote site becomes the <em>Live</em> environment.
