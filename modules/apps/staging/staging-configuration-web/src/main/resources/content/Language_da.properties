remote-publish-help=In order to be able to pulish changes to a <em>Remote Host/IP</em>, the publishing server must be added to the list of allowed servers. This is done by adding the IP of the publishing server to the property <code>tunnel.servlet.hosts.allowed</code> in the <code>portal-ext.properties</code> file of the target server. Access to the <code>/tunnel-web</code> context on the target server must not be blocked by either proxies or firewalls. Also note that if the target server is a cluster, it is safe to set the <em>Remote Host/IP</em> to the load balanced adresse of the cluster in order to increase the high availability of the publishing process.

staged-portlets-alert=Når en portlet tjekkes, dens data er kopieret til iscenesættelse og det kan ikke være muligt at redigere dem direkte i live. Når afmarkere en portlet, Sørg for, at ændringer i iscenesættelse offentliggøres først, fordi de ellers kunne være tabt. (Automatic Translation)
staged-portlets-help=Portlets that are checkmarked are <em>Staged</em>. This means that their data is published automatically whenever a page containing them is published. Those portlets which are disabled and checkmarked are always automatically exported, even if they are not on the page. Those which are disabled and not checkmarked are never automatically published. <em>Collaboration</em> portlets, such as <em>Blogs</em>, <em>Message Boards</em>, and <em>Wiki</em> are excluded from being <em>Staged</em> by default as their data typically originates in Live. Effectively, when a portlet is <em>NOT Staged</em> the <em>Live</em> environment contains the only important data. When <em>Local Live</em> staging is used, the same data is displayed whether viewing the portlet from either environment. (Automatic Copy)
