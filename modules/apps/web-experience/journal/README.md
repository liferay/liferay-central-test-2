# Liferay Journal

*Journal* is a module for Liferay 7.0 that allows non-technical users to publish content to a Liferay site without having advanced knowledge of web technology or programming of any sort.


Liferay Journal is part of the Liferay Portal project.
[Liferay Portal]
(http://www.liferay.com/community/liferay-projects/liferay-portal) is an
open source enterprise web platform for building business solutions that deliver
immediate results and long-term value. Liferay Portal started out as a personal
development project in 2000 and was open sourced in 2001.
