## **Liferay-Require-SchemaVersion** ##

Web modules (modules ending with ```-web```) should not have the header
```Liferay-Require-SchemaVersion``` included, because this header is not
processed in web modules since the web parts of an application do not have an
associated schema.

If the BND file of the module contains ```Liferay-Service: true``` and a
service.xml is present in the module, the header
```Liferay-Require-SchemaVersion``` is required.
