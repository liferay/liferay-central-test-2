## Java package formatting ##

### Naming ###

The java package name should match the directory structure of the location of
the java file.

Example:

The correct package for class UserLocalServiceImpl located in
```portal-impl\com\liferay\portal\service\impl\``` is

```java
package com.liferay.portal.service.impl;
```
