## Initial values for variables in Tag classes

When a *Tag.java contains a ```cleanUp``` method, we have to make sure
that for all the variables in the ```cleanUp``` method, the value is the same
as the initial value for the variable.

### Example

When the class contains the following ```cleanUp``` method:

```java
@Override
protected void cleanUp() {
    _escape = true;
}
```

the initial value of ```_escape``` should also be ```true```:

```java
private boolean _escape = true;
```
