    # Input a list of comma delimited class names that implement
    # com.liferay.portal.upgrade.UpgradeProcess. These classes will run on
    # startup to upgrade older data to match with the latest version.
    #
    # Escape the comma so that the property can be properly interpolated. For
    # example, the property "upgrade.processes.6100" will not properly reference
    # the property "upgrade.processes.default" unless the commas are escaped.
    # See StartupHelper#getUpgradeProcessClassNames(String).
