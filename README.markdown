# Liferay Portal

[Liferay
Portal](http://www.liferay.com/community/liferay-projects/liferay-portal) is an
open source enterprise web platform for building business solutions that deliver
immediate results and long-term value. Liferay Portal started out as a personal
development project in 2000 and was open sourced in 2001.

## Source Code
