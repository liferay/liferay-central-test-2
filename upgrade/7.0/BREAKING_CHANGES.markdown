# Breaking Changes for Liferay 7.0

## Introduction

This document present a chronological list of changes that break existing
functionality, APIs or any contract with third party liferay developers or
users. We try our best to minimize these disruptions, but sometimes they are
unavoidable.

The following type of changes are documented here:

* Functionality removed or replaced
* Incompatible API changes: Any changes done to public Java or JavaScript APIs
* Changes in context variables made available for templates
* Changes in CSS classes available to Liferay themes and portlets
* Configuration changes: Changes in portal.properties and other configuration
files
* Execution requirements: Java version, J2EE Version, Browser versions, ...
* Warnings deprecations or end of support: For example, that a certain relevant
feature or API will be dropped in an upcoming version.
* Recommendations: For example when a new API is introduced to replace an old
API that is also kept for backwards compatibility.

## Changes

Each change is described in a section that starts with a brief title describing
the change. Each section must contain the following information:

1. Date: Format must be 2014-02-25
2. What changed: Identify the component that was affected and the type of change

3. Who is affected: Is it an end user? A developer? If the only affected people

4. How do I update my code: Explain the changes necessary to update client code
(when appropriate).

change vs folowing a deprecation process.
