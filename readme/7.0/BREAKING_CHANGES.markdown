# What are the Breaking Changes for Liferay 7.0?

This document presents a chronological list of changes that break existing
functionality, APIs, or contracts with third party Liferay developers or users.
We try our best to minimize these disruptions, but sometimes they are
unavoidable.

Here are some of the types of changes documented in this file:

* Functionality that is removed or replaced
* API incompatibilities: Changes to public Java or JavaScript APIs
* Changes to context variables available to templates
* Changes in CSS classes available to Liferay themes and portlets
* Configuration changes: Changes in configuration files, like
 `portal.properties`, `system.properties`, etc.
* Execution requirements: Java version, J2EE Version, browser versions, etc.
* Deprecations or end of support: For example, warning that a certain
feature or API will be dropped in an upcoming version.
* Recommendations: For example, recommending using a newly introduced API that
replaces an old API, in spite of the old API being kept in Liferay Portal for
backwards compatibility.

*This document has been reviewed through commit `cfd3f6a`.*

## Breaking Changes Contribution Guidelines

Each change must have a brief descriptive title and contain the following
information:

* **[Title]** Provide a brief descriptive title. Use past tense and follow
the capitalization rules from 
<http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Basic_Book_Design/Capitalizing_Words_in_Titles>.
* **Date:** Specify the date you submitted the change. Format the date as
*YYYY-MMM* (e.g. 2014-Mar) or *YYYY-MMM-DD* (e.g., 2014-Feb-25).
* **JIRA Ticket:** Reference the related JIRA ticket (e.g., LPS-123456)
(Optional).
* **What changed?** Identify the affected component and the type of change that
was made.
* **Who is affected?** Are end users affected? Are developers affected? If the
only affected people are those using a certain feature or API, say so.
* **How should I update my code?** Explain any client code changes required.
* **Why was this change made?** Explain the reason for the change. If
applicable, justify why the breaking change was made instead of following a
deprecation process.

Here's the template to use for each breaking change (note how it ends with a
horizontal rule):

```
### [Title]
- **Date:**
- **JIRA Ticket:**

#### What changed?

#### Who is affected?

#### How should I update my code?

#### Why was this change made?

---------------------------------------
```

**80 Columns Rule:** Text should not exceed 80 columns. Keeping text within 80
columns makes it easier to see the changes made between different versions of
the document. Titles, links, and tables are exempt from this rule. Code samples
must follow the column rules specified in Liferay's [Development
Style](http://www.liferay.com/community/wiki/-/wiki/Main/Liferay+development+style).

The remaining content of this document consists of the breaking changes listed
in ascending chronological order.

## Breaking Changes List

### Web Content Articles must have structure and template
- **Date**: 2014-Mar-18
- **JIRA Ticket**: LPS-45107

#### What changed?
The "Basic Web Content" is now another Structure (in the Global Scope) and
therefore it can be modified or deleted. Web Content should always use a
structure and a template from now on.

#### Who is affected?
Applications that were using the Journal API to create Web Content without
Structure or Template.

#### How should I update my code?
You should always use an structure and template when you create web content.
You can still use the "Basic Web Content" from the Global Scope (using the
structureKey `basic-web-content`), but you should keep in mind that users can
modify it or even delete it.

#### Why was this change made?
This change gives users the flexibility to modify the default structure and
template.

### Merged Configured Email Signature Field into the Body of Email Messages from Message Boards and Wiki
- **Date**: 2014-Feb-28
- **JIRA Ticket**: LPS-44599

#### What changed?
The configuration for email signatures of notifications from Message Boards and
Wiki has been removed. An automatic update process is available that appends
existing signatures into respective email message bodies for Message Boards and
Wiki notifications. The upgrade process only applies to configured signatures in
the database. In case you declared signatures in portal properties (e.g.,
`portal-ext.properties`), you must make the manual changes explained below.

#### Who is affected?
Users and system administrators who have configured email signatures for Message
Boards or Wiki notifications are affected. System administrators who have
configured portal properties (e.g., `portal-ext.properties`) must make the
manual changes described below.

#### How should I update my code?
You should modify your `portal-ext.properties` file to remove the properties
`message.boards.email.message.added.signature`,
`message.boards.email.message.updated.signature`,
`wiki.email.page.added.signature`, and `wiki.email.page.updated.signature`.
Then, you should append the contents of the signatures to the bodies you had
previously configured in your `portal-ext.properties` file.

**Example**

Replace:
```
wiki.email.page.updated.body=A wiki page was updated.
wiki.email.page.updated.signature=For any doubts email the system administrator
```

With:
```
wiki.email.page.updated.body=A wiki page was updated.\n--\nFor any doubts email the system administrator
```

#### Why was this change made?
This change helps simplify the user interface. The signatures can still be set
inside the message body. There was no real benefit in keeping the signature and
body fields separate.

---------------------------------------

### Removed `get` and `format` Methods That Used `PortletConfig` Parameters
- **Date:** 2014-Mar-07
- **JIRA Ticket:** LPS-44342

#### What changed?
All the methods `get()` and `format()` which had the PortletConfig as a
parameter have been removed.

#### Who is affected?
Any invocations from Java classes or JSPs to these methods in `LanguageUtil` and
`UnicodeLanguageUtil` are affected.

#### How should I update my code?
Replace invocations to these methods with invocations to methods of the same
name that take a `ResourceBundle` parameter, instead of taking a
`PortletConfig` parameter.

**Example**

Replace:
```
LanguageUtil.get(portletConfig, locale, key);
```

With:
```
LanguageUtil.get(portletConfig.getResourceBundle(locale), key);
```

#### Why was this change made?
The removed methods didn't work properly and would never work properly, since
they didn't have all the information they required. Since we expected the
methods were rarely used, we thought it better to remove them without
deprecation than to leave them as buggy methods in the API.
