# What are the Breaking Changes for Liferay 7.0?

This document presents a chronological list of changes that break existing
functionality, APIs, or contracts with third party Liferay developers or users.
We try our best to minimize these disruptions, but sometimes they are
unavoidable.

Here are some of the types of changes documented in this file:

* Functionality that is removed or replaced
* API incompatibilities: Changes to public Java or JavaScript APIs
* Changes to context variables available to templates
* Changes in CSS classes available to Liferay themes and portlets
* Configuration changes: Changes in configuration files, like
 `portal.properties`, `system.properties`, etc.
* Execution requirements: Java version, J2EE Version, browser versions, etc.
* Deprecations or end of support: For example, warning that a certain
feature or API will be dropped in an upcoming version.
* Recommendations: For example, recommending using a newly introduced API that
replaces an old API, in spite of the old API being kept in Liferay Portal for
backwards compatibility.

*This document has been reviewed through commit `4aa4510`.*

## Breaking Changes Contribution Guidelines

Each change must have a brief descriptive title and contain the following
information:

* **[Title]** Provide a brief descriptive title. Use past tense and follow
the capitalization rules from 
<http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Basic_Book_Design/Capitalizing_Words_in_Titles>.
* **Date:** Specify the date you submitted the change. Format the date as
*YYYY-MMM* (e.g., 2014-Mar) or *YYYY-MMM-DD* (e.g., 2014-Feb-25).
* **JIRA Ticket:** Reference the related JIRA ticket (e.g., LPS-123456)
(Optional).
* **What changed?** Identify the affected component and the type of change that
was made.
* **Who is affected?** Are end users affected? Are developers affected? If the
only affected people are those using a certain feature or API, say so.
* **How should I update my code?** Explain any client code changes required.
* **Why was this change made?** Explain the reason for the change. If
applicable, justify why the breaking change was made instead of following a
deprecation process.

Here's the template to use for each breaking change (note how it ends with a
horizontal rule):

```

## Breaking Changes List

### Merged Configured Email Signature Field into the Body of Email Messages from Message Boards and Wiki
- **Date:** 2014-Feb-28
- **JIRA Ticket:** LPS-44599

#### What changed?
The configuration for email signatures of notifications from Message Boards and
Wiki has been removed. An automatic update process is available that appends
existing signatures into respective email message bodies for Message Boards and
Wiki notifications. The upgrade process only applies to configured signatures in
the database. In case you declared signatures in portal properties (e.g.,
`portal-ext.properties`), you must make the manual changes explained below.

#### Who is affected?
Users and system administrators who have configured email signatures for Message
Boards or Wiki notifications are affected. System administrators who have
configured portal properties (e.g., `portal-ext.properties`) must make the
manual changes described below.

#### How should I update my code?
You should modify your `portal-ext.properties` file to remove the properties
`message.boards.email.message.added.signature`,
`message.boards.email.message.updated.signature`,
`wiki.email.page.added.signature`, and `wiki.email.page.updated.signature`.
Then, you should append the contents of the signatures to the bodies you had
previously configured in your `portal-ext.properties` file.

**Example**

Replace:
```
wiki.email.page.updated.body=A wiki page was updated.
wiki.email.page.updated.signature=For any doubts email the system administrator
```

With:
```
wiki.email.page.updated.body=A wiki page was updated.\n--\nFor any doubts email the system administrator
```

#### Why was this change made?
This change helps simplify the user interface. The signatures can still be set
inside the message body. There was no real benefit in keeping the signature and
body fields separate.

---------------------------------------

### Removed `get` and `format` Methods That Used `PortletConfig` Parameters
- **Date:** 2014-Mar-07
- **JIRA Ticket:** LPS-44342

#### What changed?
All the methods `get()` and `format()` which had the PortletConfig as a
parameter have been removed.

#### Who is affected?
Any invocations from Java classes or JSPs to these methods in `LanguageUtil` and
`UnicodeLanguageUtil` are affected.

#### How should I update my code?
Replace invocations to these methods with invocations to methods of the same
name that take a `ResourceBundle` parameter, instead of taking a
`PortletConfig` parameter.

**Example**

Replace:
```
LanguageUtil.get(portletConfig, locale, key);
```

With:
```
LanguageUtil.get(portletConfig.getResourceBundle(locale), key);
```

#### Why was this change made?
The removed methods didn't work properly and would never work properly, since
they didn't have all the information they required. Since we expected the
methods were rarely used, we thought it better to remove them without
deprecation than to leave them as buggy methods in the API.

---------------------------------------

### Web Content Articles Now Require a Structure and Template
- **Date:** 2014-Mar-18
- **JIRA Ticket:** LPS-45107

#### What changed?
Web content is now required to use a structure and template. A default structure
and template named *Basic Web Content* was added to the global scope, and can be
modified or deleted.

#### Who is affected?
Applications that use the Journal API to create web content without a structure
or template are affected.

#### How should I update my code?
You should always use a structure and template when creating web content. You
can still use the *Basic Web Content* from the global scope (using the
structure key `basic-web-content`), but you should keep in mind that users can
modify or delete it.

#### Why was this change made?
This change gives users the flexibility to modify the default structure and
template.

---------------------------------------

### Changed the AssetRenderer and Indexer APIs to Include the `PortletRequest` and `PortletResponse` Parameters
- **Date:** 2014-May-07
- **JIRA Ticket:** LPS-44639 and LPS-44894

#### What changed?
The `getSummary()` method in the AssetRenderer API and the `doGetSummary()`
method in the Indexer API have changed and must include a `PortletRequest`
and `PortletResponse` parameter as part of their signatures.

#### Who is affected?
These methods must be updated in all AssetRenderer and Indexer implementations.

#### How should I update my code?
Add a `PortletRequest` and `PortletResponse` parameter to the signatures of
these methods.

**Example**

Replace:
```
protected Summary doGetSummary(Document document, Locale locale, String snippet, PortletURL portletURL)
```

With:
```
protected Summary doGetSummary(Document document, Locale locale, String snippet, PortletURL portletURL, PortletRequest portletRequest, PortletResponse portletResponse)
```

and replace:
```
public String getSummary(Locale locale)
```

With:
```
public String getSummary(PortletRequest portletRequest, PortletResponse portletResponse)
```

#### Why was this change made?
Some content (such as web content) needs the `PortletRequest` and
`PortletResponse` parameters in order to be rendered.

### aui:input taglib for type checkbox does not create a hidden input anymore
- **Date:** 2014-Jun-16
- **JIRA Ticket:** LPS-44228

#### What changed?
Whenever the aui:input taglib is used to generate an input of type checkbox, only an input tag will be generated, instead of the checkbox and hidden field it was generating before.
For this reason, when a checkox is not checked, the parameter is not sent to the server (therefore, doing request.getParameter("checkboxName") will return null when the checkbox was unchecked).
In order to help developers bypass this situation, we now send with the aui:form a parameter with a list of all the checkboxes that existed in the form called "checkboxNames".

#### Who is affected?
Anyone trying to grab the previously generated fields. Mostly affects JavaScript code trying to add some additional actions when clicking on the checkboxes.
It will also affect java classes assuming that a checkbox would always send a parameter on form submit with a true/false value. Now, the parameter is only sent when the input is checked.

#### How should I update my code?
- In the frontend javascript code:
 - Remove the `Checkbox` suffix when querying for the node in any of its forms; `A.one(...)`, `$(...)` ...
 - Remove any action trying to set the value of the checkbox on the previously generated hidden field
- In the backend java code:
 - Use ParamUtil.getBoolean to recover a true/false value if the checkbox was checked or not checked
 - Use PropertiesParamUtil.getProperties to recover true/false for a list of checkboxes
 - Use the parameter called "checkboxNames" to obtain all the checkboxes from the aui:form
 

#### Why was this change made?
This change:
- Makes generated forms more standard and interoperable since it falls back to the checkboxes default behaviour.
- Allows the form to be submitted properly even when JavaScript is disabled.
